//-------------
//TO DO:

//---IN PROGRESS
//NOW NEED TO SHOW THE TASKS/EVENTS FOR THE SELECTED DAY
//IF NO TASKS, SAY NO TASKS with like a message or something
//--update: started, items display for each day on taskbar
//--update: events/tasks show for each day on taskbar, styling is pretty good
//              i think there should be an image for users to easily differentiate between tasks and events
//                  (started this with the images, but the task image is wack - wip)

//---IN PROGRESS
//SHOW TASKS/EVENTS ON CALENDAR
//show max 5? the rest get condensed into like (+10 More) maybe
//  this is to condense the view and make it more digestable
//--update: shows each event/task for each day, may be condensed as stated above

//SORT ITEMS BY TIME

//SYSTEM FOR COMPLETING EVENT/TASK
//WHEN USER CLICKS, MOVE ITEM TO COMPLETED SECTION AT BOTTOM
//MAY NEED A FINISHED FLAG IN ITEM CLASS FOR THIS

//SYSTEM FOR EDITING EVENT/TASK
//SHOULD HAVE AN EDIT BUTTON OR SOMETHING ON EACH ITEM
//WHEN USER CLICKS, FORM NEEDS TO BE REOPENED WITH INFO AUTOFILLED 
//  SO USER CAN EDIT

//ALSO, CHECK THAT REQUIRED FORM ELEMENTS PROHIBIT SUBMISSION UNTIL FILLED IN
// SPOILER: I DON'T THINK THEY DO THAT, SO THERE CAN BE NULL VALUES 

//VALIDATE TIME FOR EVENTS (SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SET START TIME AFTER END TIME)

//DROP DOWN BUTTONS FOR VIEW, MONTH, YEAR
// this is next to calendar so user can change to like a weekly (or even daily) view, and can change the month/year

//ADD RECURRING TO EVENTS/TASKS

//TOP NAV BAR

//LOGO

//ADD STYLE FOR SELECTED DAY (DIFFERENT FROM CURRENT/ACTIVE DAY, THIS IS WHEN USER CLICKS A DAY TO SEE AND ADD ITEMS)

//------------
//BACKBURNER:

//uh, add color options to the event/task creation menu
// like, user can set color to easily identify what the item is for
//--update: so got the selection list, but it seems hard to style
//  will have to look into later
//  
//--update: i think that instead of selection list, customized radio buttons could be used instead 

//------------
//COMPLETED:

//SHOULD BE DONE NOW ----
//working on making the data structures for the tasks/events
//there should be a day data structure that holds a list of tasks/events
//it should be in a list
//when a day is selected, the list[day] should be displayed in the div
//---- LEAVING FOR REFERENCE (REMOVE IF DETERMINED UNNEEDED)

//FINISHED FOR NOW
//STYLE THE TASK CREATION MENU
//--update: getting closer, just got the layout for the event and task submenus
//              did notice that the priority is off by a few pixels on the task side
//              i dont know if this matters, the priority menu might change later if i can come up with a custom radio button
//--update: item creation has been styled and is in a solid spot for now!
//---- LEAVING FOR REFERENCE

//FIXED NOW
//weird bug in itemCreation that says non visible elements should be filled in
//like task elements shouldnt be null when making an event item
//--update: been thinking about this, i think when radio button is selected, the newly displayed elements can be set to required while
//            the hidden elements lose the required attribute. (even though the elements aren't visible, i think the browser is still expecting them)
//RESOLVED WITH TOGGLEFORMFIELD FUNCTION
